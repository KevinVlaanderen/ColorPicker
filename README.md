# ColorPicker
Mendix widget implementation of the jQuery Bootstrap ColorPicker widget, made available by M. Jolnic, see: http://mjolnic.com/bootstrap-colorpicker/.

This widget needs a context entity and the attribute of the entity which holds the color (either hex, rgba, hsl format)

Included settings from within the Modeler are:
- Horizontal: If true the hue and alpha bars are rendered horizontally, else vertically;
- Inline: Whether to attach the popup to the inputbox;
- Align: align the pop-up to the left or to the right;
- Format: Either Hex, Rgba or Rgb;
- Default Color: when no color selected yet, show this color.
